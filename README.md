# cps1011-assignment

---

## Description
This assignment is produced in total fulfillment for the assessment of the [CPS1011](https://www.um.edu.mt/courses/studyunit/CPS1011) study unit for the undergraduate course `B.Sc. in Computer Science and Mathematics` carried out at the [University of Malta](https://um.edu.mt).   

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Project status
This assignment is still under progress, and will be until the `submission` branch is created.
